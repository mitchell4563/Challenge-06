# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- My motivation for building this project was to provide a website where the use can see both the current and future weather conditions for any given city. Through this project I learned how to utilize APIs, including formatting returned data and pushing it through to the page.

- When the page loads it will be blank with one input bar. Enter the name of a city and the current weather and 5 day forecast will appear on 6 total cards. After pressing search, the name of the city that was just searched will be saved into local storage and appended to the search history to a maximum of 5. Clicking on a button in search history will bring you back to that city's weather page.
